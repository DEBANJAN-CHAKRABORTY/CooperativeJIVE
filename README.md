# CooperativeJIVE
R implementation of Cooperation between Joint and Individual Modalities for Multi-Omics Cancer Subtyping.

The code is available in OMICS_JIVE.R Make sure that the dataset is inside DATASET directory, and have the modalities stored as individual subdirectories, with at least one file named clustering.txt in each modality subdirectory as the feature matrix. Further, the cluster ground truth, (if available), should be stored as a vector in cluster_ground_truth.txt.
